# Schema
TEI schemas for project documents

This repo contains the schema and annotated template files to be used to enter new data while a proper form is prepared.

## Contents

- The main ODD specification is `tei-betamesaheft.xml`. 
- `tei-betamesaheft-expanded.odd` is derived ODD (that uses `tei-betamesaheft.xml` as its source) and itâ€™s meant to validate the expanded files generated in the app as well as file generated by other project.
- Both RELAXNG schemas, `tei-betamesaheft.rng` and`tei-betamesaheft-expanded.rng` are generated through the [TEIGarage](https://github.com/TEIC/TEIGarage) API.
- The main ODD specification is validated on CI. Also, the RELAXNG schemas are continuously updated on CI.

## Build requirements

- [ant](http://ant.apache.org/) version: 1.10.7 (for building from source)

# Schema
TEI schemas for project documents.

This repo contains the schema and annotated template files to be used to enter new data while a proper form is prepared.

## Contents

- The main ODD specification is `tei-betamesaheft.xml`. Files created by the team in the framework of this project must be valid against this TEI customisation.
- `tei-betamesaheft-expanded.odd` is a derived ODD (that uses `tei-betamesaheft.xml` as its source) and it is meant to validate the expanded files generated in the app as well as files generated by other related projects.
- Both RELAXNG schemas, `tei-betamesaheft.rng` and`tei-betamesaheft-expanded.rng` are generated from these ODDs through the [TEIGarage](https://github.com/TEIC/TEIGarage) API.
- The main ODD specification is validated on CI. Also, the RELAXNG schemas are continuously updated on CI.
